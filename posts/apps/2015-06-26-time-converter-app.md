I’ve made an Android app! I’ve made games for Android before, but that was using Unity. This time, I’ve made an Android app natively from the ground up.

Android programming is honestly very difficult. The concepts are foreign and new to me, and I still can’t wrap my head around most of it.

Anyway, I’ve made a time converter app. Currently, it doesn’t have many time zones that you can convert to and from, only being able to convert to and from PST, PDT, and GMT+8.

My motivation for making such an app is the fact that games have lots of patch and maintenance downtimes, and often the times for these are given in PDT or PST. For some odd reason I’m never able to remember the time difference between PST/PDT and GMT+8, and it’s a pain to use the time zone converter websites out there.
