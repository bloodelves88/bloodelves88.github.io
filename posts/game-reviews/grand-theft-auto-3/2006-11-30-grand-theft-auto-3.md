Well, because I needed a game which will last a decent amount of time, I decided to get Grand Theft Auto 3 (GTA 3). I was pretty disappointed to know that the game got released in 2002, making it a really old game. However, reviews and scores prove it to be good (never seen a score lower than 9/10).

Maybe because it was rated with the standards of 2002, I found the game actually quite bad. It was not realistic at all. Cars were too light, they spun and flipped like crazy, bullets couldn’t go through ANY car window at all, the main character NEVER talked at all (therefore I don’t even know his name), falling from high places resulted in only less than 10 health lost, trees looked like they were there wasn’t there at all (you could drive through a dense area of trees unblocked), bullet spread is unrealistic (100 shots at a point with an uzi resulted in all 100 shots hit). Sounds horrible right? Although that bullet spread thing might be a good thing for noobs. Totally way off the standards of Vice City and San Andreas.

When the main character never talks and interacts, the depth of the game naturally falls. The player doesn’t feel as immersed into the game, and starts to feel bored. Other than all those faults, the gameplay is still the same as all the other GTA titles (maybe not San Andreas), with a big world to explore and many things to destroy and drive. Oh yes, there is also no helicopters to fly. I found a helicopter and I couldn’t enter it. When I looked closely, there was no door at all. Theres a sky train system in this version of GTA though, although all you can do with it is enter it and just stand in there doing nothing (you can stand on the train too, but you might fly off at a turn).

Therefore pretty obviously, GTA: San Andreas is still the best GTA Title so far, with the highest amount of realistism. It has planes, helicopters, trains… everything. You can swim, eat, grow fat, exercise, gain muscle. The physics is good too, with things falling as they should instead of bringing a car to a crazy spin when it knocks a lamppost down like in GTA 3. I’ve also heard that GTA 4 is coming out next year. I look forward to a great time with it.
