As usual since I’m bored, I went to look for new games to play. Thus I came across this game called “SupaSupa”. It sounds a little stupid, but the game is actually pretty fun. The makers call it a first-person shooter (FPS) game, but I insist on calling it a third-person shooter (TPS) mainly because you can see your whole self. A FPS is when you can only see your hands and what your hand is holding (usually a gun). If you have played KongKong Online, you’ll find the graphics somewhat similar. The graphics are cute and colourful, and I have to say it doesn’t look very bad. There are also two different game modes, player versus player (PvP) and monster killing.

Gameplay is simple and easy to learn, and the lag isn’t much of a problem in this game. There are 5 different categories of weapons, melee, machine gun, sniper, rocket launcher and a special weapon. From these 5 different categories, there are many different kinds of weapons. However, being released just five days ago on 9 November, there aren’t many maps to play on, which makes this game really repetitive. I’m pretty sure there’ll be new maps coming up, so that shouldn’t be a big problem.
