After watching the trailer and hearing some people saying that it is similar to World of Warcraft (WoW), I decided to download the 1.13 GB file to try it out. Overall, its pretty fun and new, with good graphics and game play, with a very unique skill tree and 9 different classes to choose from, 3 classes for a race.

There is also two non-PVP servers and one PVP server, so if you like having the risk of someone coming up to you and attacking you for no apparent reason, join the PVP server.

A unique feature of the same is its pet function, where players can summon and use pets to either fight or travel. Being a Breeder allows the player to use this function to its full extent. However, it has a problem which all free MMORPGâ€™s have, which is too much grinding (to mean that a player has to fight creatures again and again to gain levels, making it a repetitive process.) So, this will be my last time ever playing a free MMORPG game as I personally hate grinding. Grinding totally kills and spoils the fun of the game. Weapons and armour is very limited, armour changes only at level 1, 20 and 50, so everyone playing the same class will generally look the same from each other.
