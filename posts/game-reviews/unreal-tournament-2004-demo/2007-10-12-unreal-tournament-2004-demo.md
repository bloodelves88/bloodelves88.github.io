This demo is undoubtedly the only demo which you can play for over 50 hours. The main game is great, and the demo is good. What’s so great about a demo?

Game demos usually let you play one or two missions in the game, giving you a little insight about the storyline and what the whole game is roughly about. The Unreal Tournament 2004 Demo tries to entice you in a whole new different way.

All this demo brings to you is: multiplayer games. That’s right, only multiplayer games. Of course you can play them with bots, but they’re kind of irritating. The multiplayer games are so popular, there are still over a hundred demo servers for you to play in, although about 70% of these servers are either empty or bot dominated. That still leaves you with about 30 servers to play in. Those who own the full game can also join the demo servers, but you can’t do otherwise. The demo is already 4 years old, by the way.

There are a few game modes, but onslaught and capture the flag modes are the most popular. There’s only either 1 or 2 maps for each mode, but you get the full function of each map.

This game is a little like Halo, with futuristic weaponry and vehicles. Fly up into the sky with a raptor, go blasting things into pieces with a tank, do quick hit and runs with a manta, and so on.

There’s something in this game that I find really amusing. Whatever you type, it will be spoken. Apparently they have some sort of technology which can read what you type. They also recognise some cyber-talk like “lol”, “brb” and many others. They’ll read it out like “laugh out loud”. They’re monotonous, and its hilarious when you try to make them speak Chinese.

The graphics aren’t very good, but at least they aren’t an eyesore. The models are well detailed, but they are not smoothly done. Sound is satisfactory, as the sound produced from a specific object will most of the time be the same sound you always hear. Not much variation there.

Overall, its a perfect demo. Its so fun and good, I bet lots of people settled on the demo and didn’t even buy the full game at all. Give it a go, its only a little under 300mb.
