I’ve tried 10 PSP games, and I think I’ve tried them enough to be able to give my opinion about these games. Just to let you know, I haven’t completed any of these games yet, except for God of War Demo. So far, PC games still > PSP games. Come on, the screen size, the controls, the graphics, the sound, the immersion… Anyway, its not right to compare a handheld device with the PC.

### Ratchet and Clank: Size Matters
This game got really good reviews from almost everyone. I tried it out myself, and I have to say its not bad. The storyline so far is not bad, but it isn’t gripping or suspenseful. The graphics are good, but it is the cartoonish sort of graphics. Don’t expect to see any blood or gore, its a game that kids can play. Usually, FPS games are really difficult to play on a PSP, but this game has the best camera controls I’ve ever seen. Aiming is easy, you can jump and run around with full maneuverability like you do in a PC game. There’s mini-games here and there, keeping the game fresh. Even so, the game gets a little boring as the excitement level isn’t very high.

### God of War: Chains of Olympus
What can I say? Its the biggest PSP game that’s coming out soon. Great graphics, great action, great gore, great fun. Can’t comment on the storyline as the only thing you can experience for now is the demo. In fact, the graphics are pushed so much to the limit that you might experience low frame rates at times.

### Burnout Dominator
Wasn’t very fun at first, but after getting some experience and practice, you feel the thrill of the game. What can be more fun than taking out your racing opponents, getting 10 burnout chains in a row and as a result, driving at over 300km/h for almost the whole race? The problem with racing games is that, I can never see where the game is heading to. Just race and race all day long…

### DJ Max Portable 2
Crap. That’s all I can say. The gameplay is fine, its the usual music game where you press buttons when the thingy comes down. Then as the game progresses you can buy special effects and stuff with money you earn from DJing. The thing that killed this game is the really really really really really…. really really… really really really crappy songs. Seriously, the songs are worse than Audition. I rather go play Audition.

### Worms 2: Open Warfare
This great classic is transferred well to the PSP. No 3D crap. The great 2D classic. Some noticeable changes is the massive graphic changes, which improved the looks of some weapons. Most of the weapons you know are still there, but some of the homing stuff and various air strikes are removed. One thing I really hate is the crappy crosshair. It definitely needs to be more precise. A dot in the middle of the crosshair would help a lot.

### Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops Plus
Biggest crap in the world ever made. What does this game have? 4 missions. That’s it. First you play these 4 missions at easy difficultly, then you play these 4 missions again at normal difficulty, then you play these 4 missions again at hard difficulty, and it goes on and on. Seriously, that’s all you do. For your info this game is a FPS stealth game.

### Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions
Turn based tactical games last really long. Anyway, this game has a great storyline. The movies in the game look really good. The odd thing is, the game is really easy in the beginning and it gets irritatingly difficult in the end. This level of difficultly forces you to grind to level up in the game, which makes the game really draggy and boring. Other then this problem, this game is almost perfect. Unfortunately, this problem is a big problem.

### The Simpsons Game
I got so irritated with the camera in this game that I got rid of it. How am I supposed to go across some sort of an obstacle course when I can’t even see what’s in front of me. An even bigger problem is that I have to stop moving if I want to change the camera angle, and if I stop moving, I fall off the obstacle course. Graphics are crap too. If you can somehow play this game with this crappy camera, you get to go through a really funny game.

### Virtua Tennis 3
For some odd reason, this is the first PSP game that’s making me play non-stop. I can’t seem to put the PSP down, and I am wishing to play the game whenever I can. When I seriously think about it, I don’t see much pull factor in the game. Crappy graphics, and all you do is hit the ball back and forth. Its a mystery to me why I’m liking this game so much…

### Warhammer 40k: Squad Command
The demo for this game got me pretty interested. When I got the full game, I got disappointed. The game becomes draggy and long, because there is practically zero variation in the missions given. Mission starts, player and computer take turns moving and attacking, one team dies/building destroyed/leader killed, mission ends. This thing goes on for about 13 or so missions. I’m not sure exactly how many missions are there.
