This game is a Real-Time Strategy (RTS) game made by Massive Entertainment. Some consider it to be a real-time tactical (RTT) game.

This game takes place mainly in America, with a few missions based in Europe. The main plot in this game is that the Cold War didn’t end, and the Russian communists decide to go on a full scale war with Europe and America. So, there are 3 playable factions available for you to play on multiplayer, USA, NATO, and Russia. However, you can only play USA and NATO in the single player campaign.

What is different about this game is that no buildings are built, and no resources are gathered. Instead, you receive a certain about of reinforcement points which can be used to call troops anywhere in the drop zone. This drop zone is predetermined for you so that doesn’t mean that you can drop your troops anywhere on the map. This allows the player to enter the battle quickly and easily, so you do not have to build up your base again and again with each passing mission. Reinforcement points are refunded slowly each second if one of your unit dies.

What I also like about the game is the tactical aids available. Tactical points are earned every time you achieve something. That achievement could be capturing command points, killing some enemies, or even repairing friendly vehicles. These tactical aids usually have a deployment time, so good prediction of where your enemy will be 10 seconds later or so is important.

Another good point of the game is its interface. Its small, its neat, and its easy to understand with a short glance. Controlling camera movements is also very functional is easy. Moving your mouse to the edges of the screen doesn’t scroll you around, it changes the angle of your view. Pressing the WASD keys scroll you around. I find this method a lot easier as it allows you to have a very good view of the area without any fuss. I really think all RTSes should adopt this method.

The storyline is also great. Heck, what’s bad about this game? This story doesn’t exactly go in chronological order. Instead of 123, it goes 213 (if you got a brain you should understand what I just said). The story has sorrow, fear, action, honour… good enough to be made into a movie. Of course, more developments need to be added if it really becomes a movie. I took part of the story in World in Conflict to use in my O-level English essay on “Heroes”. Heh, I hope the examiner doesn’t play World in Conflict.

Have I talked about the graphics? They’re the best you’ll ever see after Crysis. The amazing thing is, the graphic card requirement isn’t high at all. How they made such a stunning game require so little power, still remains a mystery to me.

I don’t really like the multiplayer, simply because of the simple rock-paper-scissors style of power. This means that one kind of unit is made to destroy another kind of unit, and that unit only. The rules can’t be bent. Tanks will kill infantry, and they’ll never destroy helicopters. Well this shouldn’t really be much of a problem, but the lack of teamwork in the game doesn’t bring out the rock-paper-scissors system. Should be much better as time passes. You also will choose one role in multiplayer mode. Infantry, support, air or armour. By choosing the role, you have access to all the units in that role, at a proper price. Trying to reinforce units from roles other then your own chosen role will result in paying ridiculously high prices.

Overall, its a great game. I haven’t met anyone who hates this game. All reviews have given it at least a 9/10.
