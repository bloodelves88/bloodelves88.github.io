## Work Experience
**VersaFleet, Senior Software Engineer**<br />
*Jul 2018 – Present*

- Optimized some heavy backend functions, reducing the time for an
API call from 30 seconds to one second.
- Set up the entire local backend framework consisting of Ruby on Rails,
Sidekiq, Redis, and the PostgreSQL database to use Docker containers,
cutting down the time required for new developers to set up their
development environment from one day to 15 minutes.
- Converted the Sidekiq architecture on Amazon Web Services (AWS) from
a single instance architecture to one that uses Docker containers via
Elastic Container Service (ECS), improving stability and autoscaling
capabilities. CloudFormation was also used to set this up.
- Set up a new development environment on AWS, consisting of the
frontend on S3, CloudFront and Route 53, to the backend and database
on EC2, RDS, ElastiCache, Load Balancers, and Target Groups.
- Automated the entire deployment pipeline using Bash and CircleCI, saving
developers three hours during every biweekly release.
- Used Ansible to track the configuration of EC2 instances, resulting in the
documentation of infrastructure as code.
- Used Terraform to set up a Kubernetes cluster on AWS,
- Managed juniors and interns by guiding them through their work, as
well as reviewing their pull requests.
- Managed the Quality Assurance team that was established in Dec 2019,
resulting in the elimination of critical bugs.

be launched per cloud gaming server.
- Implemented plugins in Unreal Engine 4, allowing the game to be
controlled remotely over a network.
- Integrated the Nvidia Capture SDK with FFmpeg, allowing games using
DirectX to be video streamed over a network.

stream of the game, as well as control the game remotely.
