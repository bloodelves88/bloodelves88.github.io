This is a game I made on my own by following a Construct 2 tutorial. It’s a simple platformer.

### (2014) [Stoic Gasa](https://joelngwt.github.io/stoic-gasa/)
The product of a school project, made using Unity 4. It’s a shooter on rails/arcade shooter, similar to games like Time Crisis and Virtua Cop.

My group’s main product of SUTD’s [Game Innovation Programme](http://gamelab.dorienherremans.com/). RocketBlade is a 3D hack and slash mobile game designed to explore the full potential of touchscreen devices to bring a Dynasty Warriors-like experience to the mobile platform.

### (2015) [Floppy Bird](https://joelngwt.github.io/FloppyBird/)
